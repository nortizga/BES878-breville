> I am a front-end web developer focusing on bringing creative designs to life on the web. • HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Vue - 11ty •

I enjoy translating designs into responsive, interactive experiences in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with semantic and accessible code. I have a passion of continuous learning of both technical and soft skills to improve my ability to deliver meaningful solutions.

Offline, I enjoy running, taking care of my plants and practicing latte art with my home espresso machine.
